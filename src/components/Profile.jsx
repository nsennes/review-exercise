        The soft and delicate colors of pastels lend themselves well to creating an ethereal and dreamy quality to the artwork. 
        When paired with clouds in the background, the artwork can convey a sense of tranquility and peace, as if the viewer is 
        gazing up at a beautiful and peaceful sky.
